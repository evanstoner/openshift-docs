toc::[]

A user builds, deploys, and manages boths applications and clusters while working with {product-title}.

{product-title} can use different command-line interface (CLI) tools that simplify these tasks by enabling users to perform various administration and development operations from the terminal.
These tools expose simple commands to manage the deployments, as well as interact with each component of the system.

In addition to built-in `microshift` command types and Linux CLI tools, the optional OpenShift CLI (`oc`) tool with an enabled subset of commands is available for you to use if you are already familiar with {OCP} and Kubernetes.
//more info on these tools is expected in the future, hence this overview assembly
